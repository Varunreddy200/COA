1.Functional blocks of a computer?

The functional blocks of a computer typically include the following:
1.Input devices: These are the devices that allow users to input data into the computer. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones.

2.Output devices: These are the devices that allow the computer to display information to the user. Examples of output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.

3.Central Processing Unit (CPU): This is the brain of the computer that performs all the processing tasks. It is responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing the flow of data.

4.Memory: This is the storage space that holds the data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. There are two main types of memory: RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).

5.Storage devices: These are devices that store data and information for long-term use. Examples of storage devices include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash drives.

6.Motherboard: This is the main circuit board that connects all the other components of the computer. It provides communication between the CPU, memory, and other components.

7.Power supply: This component provides power to the other components of the computer. It converts the AC power from the wall outlet into the DC power that the computer needs.

These functional blocks work together to enable the computer to perform its various tasks, from basic operations like browsing the internet and sending emails, to more complex tasks like video editing and 3D rendering.
